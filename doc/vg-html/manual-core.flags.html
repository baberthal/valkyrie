<div></div>
</div>
<p>As mentioned above, Valgrind's core accepts a common set of
flags.  The tools also accept tool-specific flags, which are
documented seperately for each tool.</p>
<p>You invoke Valgrind like this:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
valgrind --tool=&lt;emphasis&gt;tool_name&lt;/emphasis&gt; [valgrind-options] your-prog [your-prog options]</pre>
<p>Valgrind's default settings succeed in giving reasonable
behaviour in most cases.  We group the available options by rough
categories.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="manual-core.toolopts"></a>2.6.1. Tool-selection option</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>The single most important option.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--tool=name</tt></p>
<p>Run the Valgrind tool called <span class="emphasis"><em>name</em></span>,
    e.g. Memcheck, Addrcheck, Cachegrind, etc.</p>
</li></ul></div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="manual-core.basicopts"></a>2.6.2. Basic Options</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>These options work with all tools.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--help</tt></p>
<p>Show help for all options, both for the core and for
    the selected tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--help-debug</tt></p>
<p>Same as <tt class="computeroutput">--help</tt>, but
     also lists debugging options which usually are only of use
     to Valgrind's developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--version</tt></p>
<p>Show the version number of the Valgrind core.  Tools
    can have their own version numbers.  There is a scheme in
    place to ensure that tools only execute when the core version
    is one they are known to work with.  This was done to
    minimise the chances of strange problems arising from
    tool-vs-core version incompatibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">-v --verbose</tt></p>
<p>Be more verbose.  Gives extra information on various
    aspects of your program, such as: the shared objects loaded,
    the suppressions used, the progress of the instrumentation
    and execution engines, and warnings about unusual behaviour.
    Repeating the flag increases the verbosity level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">-q --quiet</tt></p>
<p>Run silently, and only print error messages.  Useful if
    you are running regression tests or have some other automated
    test machinery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-children=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-children=yes</tt></p>
<p>When enabled, Valgrind will trace into child processes.
    This is confusing and usually not what you want, so is
    disabled by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--log-fd=&lt;number&gt;</tt>
    [default: 2, stderr]</p>
<p>Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages
    to the specified file descriptor.  The default, 2, is the
    standard error channel (stderr).  Note that this may
    interfere with the client's own use of stderr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--log-file=&lt;filename&gt;</tt></p>
<p>Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages
    to the specified file.  In fact, the file name used is
    created by concatenating the text
    <tt class="computeroutput">filename</tt>, ".pid" and the
    process ID, so as to create a file per process.  The
    specified file name may not be the empty string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--log-socket=&lt;ip-address:port-number&gt;</tt></p>
<p>Specifies that Valgrind should send all of its messages
    to the specified port at the specified IP address.  The port
    may be omitted, in which case port 1500 is used.  If a
    connection cannot be made to the specified socket, Valgrind
    falls back to writing output to the standard error (stderr).
    This option is intended to be used in conjunction with the
    <tt class="computeroutput">valgrind-listener</tt> program.

<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="manual-core.erropts"></a>2.6.3. Error-related options</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>These options are used by all tools that can report
errors, e.g. Memcheck, but not Cachegrind.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--demangle=no</tt></p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--demangle=yes</tt> [default]</p>
<p>Disable/enable automatic demangling (decoding) of C++
    names.  Enabled by default.  When enabled, Valgrind will
    attempt to translate encoded C++ procedure names back to
    something approaching the original.  The demangler handles
    symbols mangled by g++ versions 2.X and 3.X.</p>
<p>An important fact about demangling is that function
    names mentioned in suppressions files should be in their
    mangled form.  Valgrind does not demangle function names when
    searching for applicable suppressions, because to do
    otherwise would make suppressions file contents dependent on
    the state of Valgrind's demangling machinery, and would also
    be slow and pointless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--num-callers=&lt;number&gt;</tt> [default=4]</p>
<p>By default, Valgrind shows four levels of function call
    names to help you identify program locations.  You can change
    that number with this option.  This can help in determining
    the program's location in deeply-nested call chains.  Note
    that errors are commoned up using only the top three function
    locations (the place in the current function, and that of its
    two immediate callers).  So this doesn't affect the total
    number of errors reported.</p>
<p>The maximum value for this is 50.  Note that higher
    settings will make Valgrind run a bit more slowly and take a
    bit more memory, but can be useful when working with programs
    with deeply-nested call chains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--error-limit=yes</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--error-limit=no</tt></p>
<p>When enabled, Valgrind stops reporting errors after
    30000 in total, or 300 different ones, have been seen.  This
    is to stop the error tracking machinery from becoming a huge
    performance overhead in programs with many errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--show-below-main=yes</tt></p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--show-below-main=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p>By default, stack traces for errors do not show any
    functions that appear beneath
    <tt class="computeroutput">main()</tt>; most of the time
    it's uninteresting C library stuff.  If this option is
    enabled, these entries below
    <tt class="computeroutput">main()</tt> will be shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--suppressions=&lt;filename&gt;</tt>
    [default: $PREFIX/lib/valgrind/default.supp]</p>
<p>Specifies an extra file from which to read descriptions
    of errors to suppress.  You may use as many extra
    suppressions files as you like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--gen-suppressions=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--gen-suppressions=yes</tt></p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--gen-suppressions=all</tt></p>
<p>When set to <tt class="computeroutput">yes</tt>, Valgrind
    will pause after every error shown, and print the line:
    <tt class="computeroutput">---- Print suppression ?  --- [Return/N/n/Y/y/C/c]
    ----</tt></p>
<p>The prompt's behaviour is the same as for the 
    <tt class="computeroutput">--db-attach</tt> option.</p>
<p>If you choose to, Valgrind will print out a suppression
    for this error.  You can then cut and paste it into a
    suppression file if you don't want to hear about the error in
    the future.</p>
<p>When set to <tt class="computeroutput">all</tt>, Valgrind
    will print a suppression for every reported error, without
    querying the user.</p>
<p>This option is particularly useful with C++ programs,
    as it prints out the suppressions with mangled names, as
    required.</p>
<p>Note that the suppressions printed are as specific as
    possible.  You may want to common up similar ones, eg. by
    adding wildcards to function names.  Also, sometimes two
    different errors are suppressed by the same suppression, in
    which case Valgrind will output the suppression more than
    once, but you only need to have one copy in your suppression
    file (but having more than one won't cause problems).  Also,
    the suppression name is given as <tt class="computeroutput">&lt;insert a
    suppression name here&gt;</tt>; the name doesn't
    really matter, it's only used with the
    <tt class="computeroutput">-v</tt> option which prints out
    all used suppression records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--track-fds=no</tt> [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--track-fds=yes</tt></p>
<p>When enabled, Valgrind will print out a list of open
    file descriptors on exit.  Along with each file descriptor,
    Valgrind prints out a stack backtrace of where the file was
    opened and any details relating to the file descriptor such
    as the file name or socket details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--max-stackframe=&lt;number&gt;</tt>
                          [default=2000000]
    </p>
<p>You may need to use this option if your program has large
    stack-allocated arrays.  Valgrind keeps track of your program's
    stack pointer.  If it changes by more than the threshold amount,
    Valgrind assumes your program is switching to a different stack,
    and Memcheck behaves differently than it would for a stack pointer
    change smaller than the threshold.  Usually this heuristic works
    well.  However, if your program allocates large structures on the
    stack, this heuristic will be fooled, and Memcheck will
    subsequently report large numbers of invalid stack accesses.  This
    option allows you to change the threshold to a different value.
    </p>
<p>
    You should only consider use of this flag if Valgrind's debug output
    directs you to do so.  In that case it will tell you the new
    threshold you should specify.
    </p>
<p>
    In general, allocating large structures on the stack is a bad
    idea, because (1) you can easily run out of stack space,
    especially on systems with limited memory or which expect to
    support large numbers of threads each with a small stack, and (2)
    because the error checking performed by Memcheck is more effective
    for heap-allocated data than for stack-allocated data.  If you
    have to use this flag, you may wish to consider rewriting your
    code to allocate on the heap rather than on the stack.
   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--db-attach=no</tt> [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--db-attach=yes</tt></p>
<p>When enabled, Valgrind will pause after every error
    shown, and print the line: <tt class="computeroutput">---- Attach to
    debugger ? --- [Return/N/n/Y/y/C/c] ----</tt></p>
<p>Pressing <tt class="literal">Ret</tt>, or 
    <tt class="literal">N Ret</tt> or <tt class="literal">n Ret</tt>, causes
    Valgrind not to start a debugger for this error.</p>
<p><tt class="literal">Y Ret</tt> or <tt class="literal">y Ret</tt>
    causes Valgrind to start a debugger, for the program at this
    point.  When you have finished with the debugger, quit from
    it, and the program will continue.  Trying to continue from
    inside the debugger doesn't work.</p>
<p><tt class="literal">C Ret</tt> or <tt class="literal">c Ret</tt>
    causes Valgrind not to start a debugger, and not to ask
    again.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b><tt class="computeroutput">--db-attach=yes</tt>
     conflicts with
     <tt class="computeroutput">--trace-children=yes</tt>.  You
     can't use them together.  Valgrind refuses to start up in
     this situation.</p>
<p>1 May 2002: this is a historical relic which could be
    easily fixed if it gets in your way.  Mail me and complain if
    this is a problem for you.</p>
<p>Nov 2002: if you're
    sending output to a logfile or to a network socket, I guess
    this option doesn't make any sense.  Caveat emptor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--db-command=&lt;command&gt;</tt>
    [default: gdb -nw %f %p]</p>
<p>This specifies how Valgrind will invoke the debugger.
    By default it will use whatever GDB is detected at build
    time, which is usually
    <tt class="computeroutput">/usr/bin/gdb</tt>.  Using this
    command, you can specify some alternative command to invoke
    the debugger you want to use.</p>
<p>The command string given can include one or instances
    of the <tt class="literal">%p</tt> and <tt class="literal">%f</tt>
    expansions. Each instance of <tt class="literal">%p</tt> expands to
    the PID of the process to be debugged and each instance of
    <tt class="literal">%f</tt> expands to the path to the executable
    for the process to be debugged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--input-fd=&lt;number&gt;</tt>
    [default=0, stdin]</p>
<p>When using
    <tt class="computeroutput">--db-attach=yes</tt> and
    <tt class="computeroutput">--gen-suppressions=yes</tt>,
    Valgrind will stop so as to read keyboard input from you,
    when each error occurs.  By default it reads from the
    standard input (stdin), which is problematic for programs
    which close stdin.  This option allows you to specify an
    alternative file descriptor from which to read input.</p>

<div></div>
</div>
<p>For tools that use their own version of
<tt class="computeroutput">malloc()</tt> (e.g. Memcheck and
Addrcheck), the following options apply.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p><a name="alignment"></a><tt class="computeroutput">--alignment=&lt;number&gt;</tt>
    [default: 8]</p>
<p>By default Valgrind's
    <tt class="computeroutput">malloc</tt>,
    <tt class="computeroutput">realloc</tt>, etc, return 8-byte
    aligned addresses.  This is standard for
    x86 processors.  Some programs might however assume that
    <tt class="computeroutput">malloc</tt> et al return 16- or
    more aligned memory.  The supplied value must be between 4
    and 4096 inclusive, and must be a power of two.</p>
</li></ul></div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<div><div><h3 class="title">
<a name="manual-core.rareopts"></a>2.6.5. Rare Options</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>These options apply to all tools, as they affect certain
  obscure workings of the Valgrind core.  Most people won't need
  to use these.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--run-libc-freeres=yes</tt>
     [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--run-libc-freeres=no</tt></p>
<p>The GNU C library
    (<tt class="computeroutput">libc.so</tt>), which is used by
    all programs, may allocate memory for its own uses.  Usually
    it doesn't bother to free that memory when the program ends -
    there would be no point, since the Linux kernel reclaims all
    process resources when a process exits anyway, so it would
    just slow things down.</p>
<p>The glibc authors realised that this behaviour causes
    leak checkers, such as Valgrind, to falsely report leaks in
    glibc, when a leak check is done at exit.  In order to avoid
    this, they provided a routine called
    <tt class="computeroutput">__libc_freeres</tt> specifically
    to make glibc release all memory it has allocated.  Memcheck
    and Addrcheck therefore try and run
    <tt class="computeroutput">__libc_freeres</tt> at
    exit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in some versions of glibc,
    <tt class="computeroutput">__libc_freeres</tt> is
    sufficiently buggy to cause segmentation faults.  This is
    particularly noticeable on Red Hat 7.1.  So this flag is
    provided in order to inhibit the run of
    <tt class="computeroutput">__libc_freeres</tt>.  If your
    program seems to run fine on Valgrind, but segfaults at exit,
    you may find that
    <tt class="computeroutput">--run-libc-freeres=no</tt> fixes
    that, although at the cost of possibly falsely reporting
    space leaks in
    <tt class="computeroutput">libc.so</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--weird-hacks=hack1,hack2,...</tt></p>
<p>Pass miscellaneous hints to Valgrind which slightly
    modify the simulated behaviour in nonstandard or dangerous
    ways, possibly to help the simulation of strange features.
    By default no hacks are enabled.  Use with caution!
    Currently known hacks are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle">
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">lax-ioctls</tt></p>
<p>Be very lax about ioctl handling; the only assumption
      is that the size is correct. Doesn't require the full
      buffer to be initialized when writing.  Without this, using
      some device drivers with a large number of strange ioctl
      commands becomes very tiresome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">ioctl-mmap</tt></p>
<p>Some ioctl requests can mmap new memory into your
      process address space.  If Valgrind doesn't know about these mappings,
      it could put new mappings over them, and/or complain bitterly when
      your program uses them.  This option makes Valgrind scan the address
      space for new mappings after each unknown ioctl has finished.  You may
      also need to run with
      <tt class="computeroutput">--pointercheck=no</tt> if the ioctl
      decides to place the mapping out of the client's usual address space.
      </p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--pointercheck=yes</tt> [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--pointercheck=no</tt></p>
<p>This option make Valgrind generate a check on every memory
    reference to make sure it is within the client's part of the
    address space.  This prevents stray writes from damaging
    Valgrind itself.  On x86, this uses the CPU's segmentation
    machinery, and has almost no performance cost; there's almost
    never a reason to turn it off.</p>

<a name="manual-core.debugopts"></a>2.6.6. Debugging Valgrind Options</h3></div></div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>There are also some options for debugging Valgrind itself.
You shouldn't need to use them in the normal run of things.
Nevertheless:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--single-step=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--single-step=yes</tt></p>
<p>When enabled, each x86 insn is translated separately
    into instrumented code.  When disabled, translation is done
    on a per-basic-block basis, giving much better
    translations.  This option is very useful if your program expects
    precise exceptions (if it, for example, inspects or modifies register
    state from within a signal handler).
    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--optimise=no</tt></p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--optimise=yes</tt> [default]</p>
<p>When enabled, various improvements are applied to the
    intermediate code, mainly aimed at allowing the simulated
    CPU's registers to be cached in the real CPU's registers over
    several simulated instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--profile=no</tt></p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--profile=yes</tt> [default]</p>
<p>When enabled, does crude internal profiling of Valgrind
    itself.  This is not for profiling your programs.  Rather it
    is to allow the developers to assess where Valgrind is
    spending its time.  The tools must be built for profiling for
    this to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-syscalls=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-syscalls=yes</tt></p>
<p>Enable/disable tracing of system call intercepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-signals=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-signals=yes</tt></p>
<p>Enable/disable tracing of signal handling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-sched=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-sched=yes</tt></p>
<p>Enable/disable tracing of thread scheduling events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-pthread=none</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-pthread=some</tt></p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-pthread=all</tt></p>
<p>Specifies amount of trace detail for pthread-related
    events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-symtab=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-symtab=yes</tt></p>
<p>Enable/disable tracing of symbol table reading and line
    number info reading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-cfi=no</tt>
    [default]</p>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-cfi=yes</tt></p>
<p>Enable/disable tracing of call-frame-info reading.
    Call-frame-info (CFI) is information inserted by compilers 
    which describes the relationship between adjacent call frames.
    On architectures which by default do not use a frame pointer, 
    such as AMD64, this information is essential for creating stack 
    snapshots.</p>

<p>Enable/disable tracing of malloc/free (et al)
    intercepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--trace-codegen=XXXXX</tt>
    [default: 00000]</p>
<p>Enable/disable tracing of code generation.  Code can be
    printed at five different stages of translation; each
    <tt class="computeroutput">X</tt> element must be 0 or
    1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="computeroutput">--dump-error=&lt;number&gt;</tt>
    [default: inactive]</p>
<p>After the program has exited, show gory details of the
    translation of the basic block containing the &lt;number&gt;'th
    error context.  When used with
    <tt class="computeroutput">--single-step=yes</tt>, can show
    the exact x86 instruction causing an error.  This is all
    fairly dodgy and doesn't work at all if threads are
    involved.</p>

<p>Note that Valgrind also reads options from three places:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li><p>The file <tt class="computeroutput">~/.valgrindrc</tt></p></li>
<li><p>The environment variable
    <tt class="computeroutput">$VALGRIND_OPTS</tt></p></li>
<li><p>The file <tt class="computeroutput">./.valgrindrc</tt></p></li>
</ol></div>
<p>These are processed in the given order, before the
command-line options.  Options processed later override those
processed earlier; for example, options in
<tt class="computeroutput">./.valgrindrc</tt> will take
precedence over those in
<tt class="computeroutput">~/.valgrindrc</tt>.  The first two
are particularly useful for setting the default tool to
use.</p>
<p>Any tool-specific options put in
<tt class="computeroutput">$VALGRIND_OPTS</tt> or the
<tt class="computeroutput">.valgrindrc</tt> files should be
prefixed with the tool name and a colon.  For example, if you
want Memcheck to always do leak checking, you can put the
following entry in <tt class="literal">~/.valgrindrc</tt>:</p>
<pre class="programlisting">
--memcheck:leak-check=yes</pre>
<p>This will be ignored if any tool other than Memcheck is
run.  Without the <tt class="computeroutput">memcheck:</tt>
part, this will cause problems if you select other tools that
don't understand
<tt class="computeroutput">--leak-check=yes</tt>.</p>
