Release Notes for Valkyrie 1.2.1  (25 July 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've finally been persuaded to polish some of Valkyrie's rough edges
and release her out into the big wide world on her own.

She has been completely re-written from the ground up, although there
are still some rather ugly areas (popt stuff, for example).  However,
the only external library she now relies on is Qt v.3.0.0 or higher.

Valkyrie is designed for use only with valgrind v.3.0.0 or higher: 
all support for earlier versions of has been completely abandoned.

See the documentation for more information.

For instructions on how to build/install, see the INSTALL file.



How to get Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the .tar.bz2 archive from http://www.valgrind.org/devel/guis.html



Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Valkyrie is a GPL'd graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite of tools
for debugging and profiling x86-Linux programs.  

Valkyrie uses the Qt widget library <http://www.trolltech.com>, and
will run on any platform that 
  (a) Qt runs on, and
  (b) Valgrind runs on.

Valkyrie works on most reasonably recent Linux setups.  The only sine
qua non is that you must have Qt v.3.0.0 or higher installed.  And, of
course, you will need Valgrind v.3.0.0 or higher :)


Valkyrie runs in both gui and non-gui mode, so you can use some of
Valkyrie's features without having to use the GUI.

For example:

  Given multiple logfiles generated by multiple runs on a parallel machine,
  or multiple logfiles generated by sequential runs on a single-processor
  machine for the same binary (with eg. different input data)

  Invoking valkyrie like this:
    valkyrie --gui=no --merge=<loglist-file>

  (where <loglist-file> is a file containing a list of logfiles, 
  each on a separate line)

  valkyrie will:
    - parse the multiple files into data structures;
    - mess with the data strutures to nuke the duplicates;
    - save the single merged logfile to disk in xml format

  If you invoke valkyrie like this:
    valkyrie --merge=<loglist-file>  

  Then the merged result will be auto-saved, and displayed in the GUI.



Any problems encountered with valkyrie should be reported to
