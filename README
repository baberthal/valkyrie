Release Notes for Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie supports Valgrind 3.0.0 or higher, as that is the first release
to support XML output, which Valkyrie requires.

For instructions on how to build/install, see the INSTALL file.


How to get Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To check out Valkyrie via anonymous, read-only svn access:
  svn co svn://svn.valgrind.org/valkyrie/trunk valkyrie


Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie is a GPL'd graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite of tools
for debugging and profiling x86-Linux programs.  

Valkyrie uses the Qt widget library <http://www.trolltech.com>, and
(should) run on any platform that 
  (a) Qt (>= v3.2.0) runs on, and
  (b) Valgrind (>= v3.0.0) runs on.

To get the most out of Valkyrie, you must read the Valgrind
documentation: <http://www.valgrind.org/docs/>

To get started, simply invoke valkyrie thusly:
  valkyrie ./myprog

This will transparently call Valgrind and display it's output.
For more help on Valkyrie, use the built-in Help->Handbook.

Valkyrie includes an auxiliary tool, vk_logmerge, which can read XML
output from multiple Valgrind (Memcheck) runs, and merge them together
into a single XML file.  Valkyrie can display the merged result.

Example:
  Given multiple logfiles generated by multiple runs on a parallel machine,
  or multiple logfiles generated by sequential runs on a single-processor
  machine for the same binary (with eg. different input data)

  Invoking valkyrie like this:
    valkyrie --merge=<log-file-list>

  where <log-file-list> is a file containing a list of xml logfiles, 
  each on a separate line.

  valkyrie calls vk_logmerge to:
    - parse the multiple files into data structures;
    - mess with the data strutures to nuke the duplicates;
    - and finally displays the result.
