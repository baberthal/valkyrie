Release Notes for Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie works on most reasonably recent Linux setups.  The only sine
qua non is that you must have Qt v.3.2.0 or higher installed.  And, of
course, you will need Valgrind v.3.0.0 or higher :)

For instructions on how to build/install, see the end of this file.



Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie is a GPL'd graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite of tools
for debugging and profiling x86-Linux programs.  She uses the Qt
widget library <http://www.trolltech.com>, and will run on any
platform that (a) Valgrind runs on, and (b) Qt runs on.  You can use
some of Valkyrie's features without having to use the GUI -- for
example:

  Given multiple files generated by multiple runs on a parallel machine,
  or multiple files generated by sequential runs on a single-processor 
  machine for the same binary (with eg. different input data):
    - parse the multiple files into data structures;
    - mess with the data strutures to nuke the duplicates;
    - emit the result in xml format

The result can be saved to file and/or displayed.



Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A comprehensive user guide is supplied.  Point your browser at
$PREFIX/share/doc/valkyrie/index.html, where $PREFIX is whatever you
specified with --prefix= when building.



Building and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install from a tar.bz2 distribution:

  3. Run ./configure, with some options if you wish. The standard
     options are documented in the INSTALL file.  The only interesting
     one is the usual --prefix=/where/you/want/it/installed.

  4. Do "make".

  5. Do "make install", possibly as root if the destination permissions
     require that.

  6. See if it works.  Try "valkyrie ls -l".  Either this works, or 
     it bombs out with some complaint.  In that case, please let me know.

Important!  Do not move the valkyrie installation into a place
different from that specified by --prefix at build time.  This will
cause things to break in subtle and annoying ways.
