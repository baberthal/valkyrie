Release Notes for Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie works on most reasonably recent Linux setups.  The only sine
qua non is that you must have Qt v.3.2.0 or higher installed.  And, of
course, you will need Valgrind v.3.0.0 or higher :)

For instructions on how to build/install, see the end of this file.



Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie is a GPL'd graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite of tools
for debugging and profiling x86-Linux programs.  She uses the Qt
widget library <http://www.trolltech.com>, and will run on any
platform that (a) Valgrind runs on, and (b) Qt runs on.  You can use
some of Valkyrie's features without having to use the GUI -- for
example:

  Given multiple files generated by multiple runs on a parallel machine,
  or multiple files generated by sequential runs on a single-processor 
  machine for the same binary (with eg. different input data):
    - parse the multiple files into data structures;
    - mess with the data strutures to nuke the duplicates;
    - emit the result in xml format

The result can be saved to file and/or displayed.



Building and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install from a tar.bz2 distribution, you may need to be logged in
as root, depending on the permissions of the directories where you
choose to install Valkyrie.


1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

     cd /usr/local
     bzip2 -d valkyrie-X.X.X.tar.bz2  # uncompress the archive
     tar xvf valkyrie-X.X.X.tar       # unpack it

   This creates the directory /usr/local/valkyrie-X.X.X containing 
   the files from the archive.


2. Rename valkyrie-X.X.X to valkyrie (or make a symlink):

     mv valkyrie-X.X.X valkyrie

   The rest of this file assumes that Valkyrie is installed in
   /usr/local/valkyrie.


3. Configuring:

   To configure Valkyrie for your machine, type:

     ./configure

   Run ./configure -help to get a list of configuration options; the 
   standard options are documented in the INSTALL file.  The only
   interesting one is the usual --prefix=/where/you/want/it/installed.


3. Building and compiling:

   To compile, type:

     make

   At this point you will (hopefully) have a binary created in 
   eg. /usr/local/valkyrie/bin.  If you supplied a custom install 
   directory using the -prefix parameter in step 2, you can:

     make install

   This will install Valkyrie onto your machine using the paths 
   you've set. (See ./configure -help for more information). 


4. The online HTML documentation is installed in
   /usr/local/valkyrie/doc/html/.
   The main page is /usr/local/valkyrie/doc/html/index.html


That's all.  Valkyrie is now installed.  See if it works.  
Try "valkyrie ls -l".  Either this works, or it bombs out with some 
complaint.  In that case, please let me know.
