Release Notes for Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie version 1.3.0 supports Valgrind 3.3.x.

For instructions on how to build/install, see the INSTALL file.


Support for other versions of Valgrind
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valgrind 3.2.x is not supported - you will need Valkyrie 1.2.x.

The upcoming Valgrind 3.4.x series will have xml changes for 
which you will need Valkyrie version 1.4.x - Valkyrie 1.3.x does not,
and will not, support Valgrind 3.4.x.


How to get Valkyrie
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To check out Valkyrie via anonymous, read-only svn access:
  svn co svn://svn.valgrind.org/valkyrie/trunk valkyrie


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Qt (v3.2.0 to v3.3.6) <http://www.trolltech.com>
Valgrind (>=v3.0.0) <http://www.valgrind.org>


Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valkyrie is a GPL'd graphical front-end to the Valgrind suite
of tools for debugging and profiling programs.

Valkyrie uses the Qt widget library, and (should) run on any platform
that both Qt and Valgrind run on.

To get the most out of Valkyrie, you must read the Valgrind
documentation: <http://www.valgrind.org/docs/>

To get started, simply invoke valkyrie thusly:
  valkyrie ./myprog

This will transparently call Valgrind and display it's output.
For more help on Valkyrie, use the built-in Help->Handbook.

Valkyrie includes an auxiliary tool, vk_logmerge, which can read XML
output from multiple Valgrind (Memcheck) runs, and merge them together
into a single XML file.  Valkyrie can display the merged result.

Example:
  Given multiple logfiles generated by multiple runs on a parallel machine,
  or multiple logfiles generated by sequential runs on a single-processor
  machine for the same binary (with eg. different input data)

  Invoking valkyrie like this:
    valkyrie --merge=<log-file-list>

  where <log-file-list> is a file containing a list of xml logfiles, 
  each on a separate line.

  valkyrie calls vk_logmerge to:
    - parse the multiple files into data structures;
    - mess with the data strutures to nuke the duplicates;
    - and finally displays the result.


Please report any problems encountered with valkyrie to
