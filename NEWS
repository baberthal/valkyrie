Release 1.2.0 (?? June 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.2.0 fixes a bunch of bugs from 1.1.0.  There is no major new
functionality, but serious work has gone into redesigning and
stabilising the current functionality.

Major changes are:
- Much improved gathering/processing/display of Valgrind's XML output.
  This is much more resilient to the various things that can go awry,
  and gives useful feedback if things didn't go smoothly.
- Auto-conf/make now used for the configure/build system.
- The client program remains connected to the terminal in which Valkyrie
  was started, so input/output via stdin/out/err are transparently
  forwarded to/from the client.
  Valkyrie output (e.g. errors) is prefixed with '===valkyrie:pid==='.
- Option values are no longer auto-saved to disk.  Any options set
  either via the GUI Option pages, or via the command line, are only
  saved to disk if 'Options->Save As Default' is selected.

Minor new functionality:
- External links in the Help/Handbook will now open in a (configureable)
  browser.
- Other source editors than emacs/nedit supported, but up to user to
  set the right flag to open editor at correct line.
- Extra font option for the Tool's: e.g. Memcheck's tree-view.
- Support for new Valgrind (Memcheck) flag: --undef-value-errors

A zillion other small changes have abstracted Valkyrie's code to make it
easier to maintain and extend.
