Version 2.1.2 (30 June 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I've finally been persuaded to polish some of Valkyrie's rough edges
and release her out into the big wide world on her own.

She has been completely re-written from the ground up, although there
are still some rather ugly areas (popt stuff, for example).  However,
the only external library she now relies on is Qt v.3.2.0 or higher.

Valkyrie is designed for use only with valgrind 3.0.0 or higher: all
support for earlier versions of valgrind has been completely
abandoned.

See the documentation for more information.
