Release 1.3.0 (30 June 2008)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.3.0 has focused on stability with a view to the forthcoming support
for Helgrind, Valgrind's new thread-checking tool.  Valkyrie now supports
Valgrind 3.3.0.  And, of course, the usually collection of bug fixes.

OTHER NEW STUFF:
- Added option to set working directory (via cmdline and vk config)
- Allow for multiple suppressions on the command line

BUGS and PROBLEMS FIXED: 

- Cleanup compiler warnings.
  Thanks to Diego Petten

- Better editor support in configure: gvim, gview, kate
  Thanks to Pim Nijdamd, Anton Dudarenko

- Clicking valgrind options item the first time would lead to a crash; init()
  executed updates to the page, which tried to update the page before it had
  been setup completely.
  Thanks to Pengcheng Zou

- Fixed null ptr defef, which happened if memcheck finished before expected
  while reading logfile.
  Thanks to Gert Steenssens

- Do not prevent horizontal scrolling for log window
  Thanks to Anton Dudarenko.

- Fixed log dir setup (as requested by many!)  Temporary logs are now always 
  written to /tmp/valkyrie_logs (configured value).  Added a user configurable
  "Log Dir", which is used as the default dir when saving logs.

- Compile errors for Slackware 10.1

- Various compiler warnings

- Fixed open/close items buttons
 - open current item: only worked once item had been opened once already
 - open all items: didn't open leak errors (stopped at suppressions)
 - open all items: remained 'pushed' even if all items were closed




Release 1.2.0 (02 June 2006)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.2.0 fixes a bunch of bugs from 1.1.0.  There is no major new
functionality, but serious work has gone into redesigning and
stabilising the current functionality.

Major changes are:
- Much improved gathering/processing/display of Valgrind's XML output.
  This is much more resilient to the various things that can go awry,
  and gives useful feedback if things didn't go smoothly.
- Auto-conf/make now used for the configure/build system.
- The client program remains connected to the terminal in which Valkyrie
  was started, so input/output via stdin/out/err are transparently
  forwarded to/from the client.
  Valkyrie output (e.g. errors) is prefixed with '===valkyrie:pid==='.
- Option values are no longer auto-saved to disk.  Any options set
  either via the GUI Option pages, or via the command line, are only
  saved to disk if 'Options->Save As Default' is selected.

Minor new functionality:
- Merging Memcheck XML logs now supported via GUI.
- External links in the Help/Handbook will now open in a (configureable)
  browser.
- Other source editors than emacs/nedit supported, but up to user to
  set the right flag to open editor at correct line.
- Extra font option for the Tool's: e.g. Memcheck's tree-view.
- Support for new Valgrind (Memcheck) flag: --undef-value-errors

A zillion other small changes have abstracted Valkyrie's code to make it
easier to maintain and extend.
