Installing Valkyrie Version 1.2.0  (30 June 2005)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you build valkyrie, you must run the 'configure' script to set
platform information, paths and other settings.  You can use the
--platform option to specify the operating system and compiler you are
using.  Note that valkyrie uses the Qt mkspecs/ files to do this, so 
you need to ensure this directory is available [/usr/lib/qt3/mkspecs/].

Example:

  ./configure --shared --thread=yes --qt-dir=/usr/lib/qt3 --vg-exec=/path/to/valgrind/bin/valgrind --vg-supp=/path/to/valgrind/lib/valgrind/



Building and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install from a .tar.bz2 distribution, you may need to be logged in
as root, depending on the permissions of the directories where you
choose to install Valkyrie.


1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

     cd /usr/local
     bzip2 -d valkyrie-X.X.X.tar.bz2  # uncompress the archive
     tar xvf valkyrie-X.X.X.tar       # unpack it

   This creates the directory /usr/local/valkyrie-X.X.X containing 
   the files from the archive.


2. Rename valkyrie-X.X.X to valkyrie (or make a symlink):

     mv valkyrie-X.X.X valkyrie
   or
     ln -s valkyrie-X.X.X valkyrie

   The rest of this file assumes that Valkyrie is installed in
   /usr/local/valkyrie.


3. Configuring:

   To configure Valkyrie for your machine, type:

     ./configure

   configure will tell you if it cannot find something it needs.
   Run ./configure --help to get a list of configuration options.


4. Building:

   To compile, type:

     make

   At this point you will (hopefully) have a binary created in 
   eg. /usr/local/valkyrie/bin.  If you supplied a custom install 
   directory using the --prefix parameter in step 3, you can:

     make install

   This will install Valkyrie onto your machine using the paths 
   you've set. (See ./configure -h for more information). 


4. The documentation is installed in /usr/local/valkyrie/doc/html/.
   The main page is /usr/local/valkyrie/doc/html/index.html


That's all.  Valkyrie is now installed.  See if it works.  
Try "valkyrie ls -l".  Either this works, or it bombs out with some 
complaint.  In that case, please let me know.
