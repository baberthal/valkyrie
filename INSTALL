Introduction
============

Valkyrie uses qmake to be built.
qmake is part of a Qt distribution. 

If you want to play around with the build config, check out:
valyrie.pro    - main qmake project file
src/src.pro    - the meat of the project
vk_config.pri  - project include file: included everywere

In particular, you may want to edit the following:
- src/src.pro:
  SOURCES += /usr/share/qtcreator/gdbmacros/gdbmacros.cpp
Note: Qt want this in order to create lots of debug info. If you're not debugging, then you probably don't want this. Is also rather nasty to hardcode the path in like this, but I don't know of a good workaround...

- vk_config.pri:
  CONFIG           += silent      # make --quiet
  CONFIG           += debug       # release/debug



*) Build and run without "installing"
=====================================

 qmake
 make


The valkyrie binary is put here: ./bin/valkyrie
make clean to clean up and start again
make distclean to _really_ clean up and start again.



*) Build and install
=====================

 qmake PREFIX=<your_dir>
 make
 make install


That's it!

Note: you may come across INSTALL_ROOT in src.pro
 - it seems to be a qt special which can't easily(?) be set, hence the PREFIX solution.
