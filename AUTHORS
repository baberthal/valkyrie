Donna Robinson was the original founder, designer and author.

Cerion Armour-Brown designed/wrote the XML gathering/processing/display,
vk_logmerge, and generally abstracted and solidified the code.

And lots and lots of other people sent bug reports, patches, and very 
helpful feedback.  Thank you all.
